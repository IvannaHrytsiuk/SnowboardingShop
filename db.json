      "description": "The 2020 Lib Tech T.Rice Pro HP men's snowboard is an all-around great board for whatever style riding you like, even powder riding. This Lib Tech snowboard has a directional twin shape with a hybrid camber, which is camber underneath the bindings that gives the board a pressured carving area between your feet while still keeping the pop you love in the tip and tail. Flexing at medium to stiff, this board is great for cruising the groomers, navigating the powder and sending it off the jumps. Magne-Traction® edges provide an effortless edge hold in any condition. The base of the T.Rice Pro HP features sintered technology that gives the board a super fast finish when waxed that will have you cruising at higher speeds. No matter your riding ability, rip the 2020 Lib Tech T.Rice Pro HP men's snowboard all over the mountain this winter so you can see why it's Travis Rice's favorite.",

After a many years of playing in the snow Morgan decided to get a 'proper job' and joined the Army, commissioning from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. He never really left the mountains however and was able to race, coach and instruct for the Army as well as the occasional busman's holiday back to the Three Valleys to teach with the Snowlimits team. Having decided that life in the mountains, and sliding around with people like you is more fun than a 'proper job', Morgan is now back in the mountains full time heading up our snowboard school bringing his vast technical knowledge and ability to teach all ages and any level to help you get the most from your time on snow, whether you are on 1 plank or 2!",

The Snowbombing festival is one of the best mountain festivals worldwide and takes place in west Austria’s town of Mayrhofen. It’s definitely something you are not going to want to miss.<br><br>The glorious mountain scape has it all.

The ‘hof hosts daily lessons from numerous qualified instructors to take your ski and boarding skills to the next level.<br><br>Take a crack at the Penken and Ahorn slopes as well as the Vans Penken Park for backcountry skiing, epic carving and freestyle tricks. After some adrenaline-filled runs, head over to one of the five mountain venues for massive dance parties on the piste.<br><br>Can’t get enough of the music? Headline venues offer world-class DJs spinning enchanting tracks in arctic forests, Austria’s streets and underground arenas. There is no shortage of live music or epic stages.<br><br>Hitting the slopes by day and partying all night can take a toll on even the hardest ragers. That’s why the Snowbombing festival offers several ways for attendees to relax and unwind.<br><br>Decompress in top-tier spas or rooftop hot tubs. Stretch out your sore muscles in alpine yoga sessions amidst nature’s purest forests. Don’t forget to pig out or fine dine at the dozens of restaurants that the ‘hof has to offer!",

If you’re a novice/intermediate don’t even think about it. The number of people sliding down that slope arse over face is comical. Not worth sacrificing the headline event at the end of the week!<br><br>Try and ski the glacier if you can.

      "get": "<strong>By Car</strong><br>Part of the Snowbombing experience is to drive from home to Mayrhofen where you eventually reach the valleys of Austria dwarfed by snow capped mountains and lush greenery. Winding down the window you take in a breath of fresh mountain air that revives you after seemingly endless motorways. The stunning beauty of Mayrhofen’s landscape and the timeless architecture of its hotels and guesthouses makes this festival distinct from anything you’ve experienced.<br><br>As you drive into the town itself you are greeted with huge banners, signs for festival venues and bunting wrapped across the small windy streets of this intimate venue. People dressed in ski gear mingle with those in costume as well as the locals who seem unfazed by the ludicrousness of this annual event that transforms Mayrhofen-Hippach for a whole week.<br><br><strong>By Plane</strong><br>The closest airport to Mayrhofen is Innsbruck (INN). From there you can take the public bus (route F) to Innsbruck Hauptbahnhof (central bus & train station). At the central station you can jump on a train to Jenbach where you can change for the Zillertalbahn, a train that goes through the beautiful Zillertal to Mayrhofen.<br><br>Alternatively you can get a direct shuttle from the airport that usually drops you off at your accommodation.
