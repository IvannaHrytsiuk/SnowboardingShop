            <h4>Warranty Repair Guidelines</h4>
            <div>
                <h5>How do I make a warranty repair claim?</h5>
                <p>It’s easy. Submit your warranty repair claim using the form below.</p>
                <p>In many cases, a spare part is all you need. It’s often faster for us to ship parts to you, than for you to ship your item back to us. If you know what you need, simply contact us to request spare parts.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h5>What Does Lifetime Warranty Mean?</h5>
                <p>The term "Lifetime" refers to the reasonable lifetime of the product. This does not mean your lifetime but rather the lifetime of the materials and components that go into the finished product. We do our best to select high quality materials and components that meet our quality standards, but even the best materials have a lifespan and will eventually degrade. We evaluate a product’s lifetime by its intended use and how much use it gets, and not by how old it is.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h5>Will my item be repaired or replaced?</h5>
                <p>We’ve made it our mission to repair and extend the life of our products whenever possible. It’s better for the planet and in most cases, our products have a lot of life left in them! We evaluate every claim carefully and if we cannot repair an item and it’s covered under warranty, we will replace it with the same item or a similar item of equal value.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h5>How can I find out the status of my repair claim?</h5>
                <p>You can track your package with your shipper to determine the deliver status. Within 48 hours (Monday – Friday and excluding holidays) of receiving your package, we’ll send you an email confirming receipt of your item and our Warranty Team will check it in for evaluation. Once we’ve evaluated your item we’ll contact you to let you know the results of our evaluation and next steps. Repairs typically take 3-4 weeks but can be longer during the peak winter season, November – March.</p>

                <h5>How long will it take to evaluate my repair claim?</h5>
                <p>Our goal is to check in and evaluate your repair claim within 48 hours (Monday – Friday and excluding holidays) of receipt. Once we’ve evaluated your item we’ll contact you with next steps.</p>

            <div>
                <h5>How long will the repair take?</h5>
                <p>The repair turnaround time depends on the type of repair. Our typical repair turnaround time is 3-4 weeks, but can be longer during our peak winter season, November - March. We will contact you with the repair turnaround time once we have completed our evaluation.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h5>Does my item need to be clean before sending it in for repair?</h5>
                <p>Yes. For safety and sanitary reasons, we require all Outerwear and Clothing be cleaned and dry prior to sending in for repair evaluation.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h5>What types of damage are not covered by the warranty policy?</h5>
                <p>Damage due to misuse, abuse, accidents, neglect, normal wear and tear, theft or damage caused by anything other than defect in materials and workmanship are not covered by the warranty policy.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h5>What if my product is not covered under warranty?</h5>
                <p>If your item is not covered under the warranty policy but is repairable, we can return the item to you “as is” or complete the repair for a reasonable charge. We’ll contact you to discuss your options.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h5>What is “wear and tear”?</h5>
                <p>Nothing lasts forever, even though we wish it could! Products exposed to the elements and used frequently can show wear and tear faster than those used less frequently. Your product may simply have reached the end of its practical lifetime.</p>
